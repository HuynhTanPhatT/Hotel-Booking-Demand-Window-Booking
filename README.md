# üìåBackground & Overview
## Objective:
üìñWhat is this probject about?
This project aims to build a PowerBi dashboard using `Hotel Booking` dataset, which including data on transactions (**Booking Status**, **Booking Information**), guest details (**Guest Information**, **Country**), and booking-related dates (**Check In**, **Reservation Date**). Additionally, it also includes service-related data (**Meal**, **Room Type**). The goal is to provide the **Revenue Manager** with **data-driven insights** to:
- Understand the current business performance
- Identify the root cause of cancellations.
- Uncover guest behavior pattern for cancellations.
- Support better decision-making to decrease cancellations while keeping `No Deposit` payment option.

ü•∑ Who is this project for ?
- Revenue Manager

‚ùì Business Question:
- What is the current performance of the hotels?
- Which segments contribute the most to the cancellation rate?
- How much revenue did the hotel lose due to cancelled bookings?
- Which segments and guest groups should be prioritized for improvement?

| From Table | To Table | Join Key | Relationship Type |
|-------------|-----------|-----------|------------------|
| `FactTable` | `DimBookingStatus` | `booking_status_id` | Many-to-One (each booking record includes a single booking status, reservation status, deposit type) |
| `FactTable` | `DimBookingInfo` | `booking_info_id` | Many-to-One (each booking belongs to one booking info record (distribution channel, market segment, hotel type)) |
| `FactTable` | `DimCountry` | `countr_code` | Many-to-One (each booking is made by a customer from one country; many bookings can make by the same country) |
| `FactTable` | `DimCustomer` | `customer_segment_id` | Many-to-One (each booking belongs to one customer type) |
| `FactTable` | `DimService` | `service_id` | Many-to-One (each booking record incudes a resered room, meal type)|
| `FactTable` | `DimBucket` | `bucket_id` | Many-to-One (each booking is grouped into one bucket based on "window booking")|
| `FactTable` | `DimDate` | `check_in` | Many-to-One (each booking has one check-in date, which links to the calendar dimension for time-based analysis.) |
